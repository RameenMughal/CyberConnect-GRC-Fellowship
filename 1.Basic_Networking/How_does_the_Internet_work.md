## What is the Switch and why we need it?

Switch is the device we use for computers in the same environment to communicate with each other.

In order to connect multiple devices in the same network, we can use cables (mostly copper cables) to connect devices to the switch.

In small environments like home, usually CAT-5 or CAT-6 cables are used. CAT-6 Cables are faster than CAT-5 Cables

Cat means Category. On the other hand some networks use fiber-optic cables as well. Fiber-optic cables are generally much faster than copper cables in data transmission.

Switch only works with cables.

If you want the devices in the same environment to be connected to each other over wireless technology, you should use *Access Point* device instead of switch.

Difference between Access Point and Switch is that Access Point uses wireless communication while Switch uses cable communication.

Local Area Network (LAN) is created by the network of having devices connected to each other by the Switch
